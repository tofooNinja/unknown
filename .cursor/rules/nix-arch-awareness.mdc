# Architecture Awareness

- Treat `pix*` hosts as `aarch64-linux` targets.
- Prefer native aarch64 build paths or remote builders for Pi artifacts.
- Avoid defaulting to expensive x86->aarch64 cross-compilation unless requested.
- For installer images, use:
  - `.#packages.aarch64-linux.createInstallSD-pix5`
  - `.#packages.aarch64-linux.createInstallSD-pix4`
