# Nix Secrets Safety

- Never print decrypted secret values from SOPS files in chat responses.
- Never write plaintext secrets into files inside this repo.
- Never commit keys, decrypted temp files, or credentials.
- When secret-related commands are required, prefer metadata-only checks first.
- If debugging requires decrypted output, summarize non-sensitive findings only.

## Sensitive Paths

- `../nix-secrets/sops/*.yaml`
- `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`
- `hosts/pi/space-cache-public-key.txt` is public and can be shown.
