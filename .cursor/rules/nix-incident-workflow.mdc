# Incident Workflow

When investigating host issues, follow this sequence:

1. Gather evidence (`journalctl`, `dmesg`, `systemctl status`).
2. State one or two likely hypotheses.
3. Run the minimum command needed to verify each hypothesis.
4. Propose the smallest safe config change.
5. Re-run checks and summarize residual risk.

Keep evidence snippets concise and avoid full log dumps unless requested.
